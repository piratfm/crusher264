## TODO: ##

  * Support different samplerates (not only 48kHz), because flash-players don't like this sr.
  * Check NTSC support (it works in encoder-mode, but may not work on capture-mode).
  * Fix bug with codec hot-starting. (half-done)
  * Add MG3500 (H.264 HD Encoder) Support.
  * Move some parts of code into v4l driver.
  * Add i2c functionality. (partially done)
  * Add encoding (not only capture) functionality to CrusherCapture device (if possible).
